## Problems faced during the project

- One main problem I faced was to convert the given json data for the app to use. There were tons of resources but I thought it would be same as kotlin by creating a model class and converting the json to the model class. But that was quite problematic as I have zero experience in flutter and then found out that there was no need to create a model class and I can simply just load the resources of the classess.json as a String with root bundle and make a dynamic list.
- Another problem I faced was to change the state of the floatingActionButton. I have implemented the feature of not being able to click the button if no checkbox is checked but the color of the button seemed to stay constant.
- One more problem was the the release apk that was created could not load the Network Images. I thought flutter automatically adds the permissions to the app for both android and iOS but I had to manually add it. (Could not test for an ipa file as I don't have a mac system).
